              During the 1930s Depression, many Americans, nearly helpless
              against forces they didnâ€™t understand, made heroes of outlaws who
              took what they wanted at gunpoint. Of all the lurid desperadoes,
              one man, John Herbert Dillinger, came to evoke this Gangster Era
              and stirred mass emotion to a degree rarely seen in this country.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dillinger, whose name once dominated the headlines, was a
              notorious and vicious thief. From September 1933 until July 1934,
              he and his violent gang terrorized the Midwest, robbing banks and
              police arsenals, and staging 3 jail breaks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here at Dillinger Distillery, we attempt to carefully re-create
              that era, both it's beauty and ugly. We use the elements of our
              local history to push our bright future. Come sip on one of our
              finely crafted spirits today, and experience history in your own
              perspective.

            In 1997 John Doe, having a slight addiction to American History and
            a love for whiskey, dreamed of creating a place that could capture
            the taste of an era. With the help of his hard-working wife and a
            couple local investors, Dillinger Distillery was born later that
            year in July. John picked South Bend as home due to it's rich
            history with prohibition, and it being Dillinger's last robbery in
            his infamous career. A beautiful city which happens to be located on
            winding river, South Bend was home to industrial tycoons and
            brilliant scientists. Dllinger Distillery participates in many local
            parades and traditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            To this day, John oversees all distilling operations as well as
            keeping up the storefront. Having served over 10,000 patrons as well
            as some notable celeberitys, Dillinger Distillery is still your best
            bet for a tasty and satisfying whiskey experience in Northern
            Indiana.
